#### **Problem Statement :-**

**The Financial Literacy and Access Gap**

* *The Problem:* Despite living in a digital economy, over 60% of young adults lack basic financial literacy and struggle with personal financial management. Traditional financial services are inaccessible to many, while existing apps address symptoms rather than root causes of poor financial health.


* *Your Challenge:* Address the fundamental problems preventing people from achieving financial wellness. How might you bridge the gap between financial knowledge and financial behavior? What would comprehensive financial empowerment look like?
